Tasks at project 0x0A. Python - Inheritance:

    Requirements:
        Python Scripts:
            Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
            All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
            All your files should end with a new line
            The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
            A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
            Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
            All your files must be executable
            The length of your files will be tested using wc
        Python Test Cases:
            Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
            All your files should end with a new line
            All your test files should be inside a folder tests
            All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
            All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
            All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").doc)')
            All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").MyClass.doc)')
            All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").my_function.doc)' and python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").MyClass.my_function.doc)')
            A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
            We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

    Task 0: Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.

    Task 1: Write a class MyList that inherits from list.

    Task 2: Write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False.

    Task 3: Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.

    Task 4: Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False.

    Task 5: Write an empty class BaseGeometry.

    Task 6: add public instance area.

    Task 7: add public instance integer_validator.

    Task 8: Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).
